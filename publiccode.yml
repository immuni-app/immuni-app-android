    longDescription: >
      Immuni is a technological solution that centres on **an iOS and Android
      smartphone app.** It helps us to fight the COVID-19 pandemic by notifying
      users at risk of carrying the virus as early as possible—**even when they
      are asymptomatic.** These users can then isolate themselves to avoid
      infecting others, and seek medical advice.


      Immuni’s design and development are based on five main principles:
      **utility, accuracy, scalability, transparency,** and **privacy.**


      It features a **contact tracing** system based on **Bluetooth Low
      Energy:**

          - When two users come sufficiently close to each other for long enough, their devices record each other’s _rolling proximity identifier_ in their local memory. These identifiers are generated from _temporary exposure keys_ and change multiple times each hour. These keys are **generated randomly** and change once per day.
          - When a user tests positive for SARS-CoV-2, the virus causing  COVID-19, they have the option to upload to a server their recent  temporary exposure keys. This operation can only happen with the  validation of a **healthcare operator.**
          - The app periodically downloads the new temporary exposure keys and  uses them to derive the infected users’ rolling proximity identifiers  for the recent past. It then matches them against those stored in the  device’s memory and **notifies the user** if a risky contact has occurred.
          - The system uses **no geolocation data** whatsoever,  including GPS data. So, the app cannot tell where the contact with a  potentially contagious user took place, nor the identities of those  involved.

      To implement its contact tracing functionality, Immuni leverages **the
      Apple and Google Exposure Notification framework.** This allows Immuni to
      be more resilient than otherwise would be possible.


      Besides the temporary exposure keys, the Immuni app also sends to the
      server some analytics data. These include **epidemiological and technical
      information,**  and are sent for the purpose of helping the National
      Healthcare Service  (Servizio Sanitario Nazionale) to provide effective
      assistance to  users, in compliance with art. 6.2.b and 6.3 of the Law
      Decree 28/2020.


      Immuni is being developed while paying a lot of attention to user  privacy
      and a number of measures have been taken to protect it. For  example, the
      app collects **no personal data that would disclose the user’s identity,**
      such as the user’s name, age, address, email, or phone number.
