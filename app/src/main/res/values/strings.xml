    <string name="verify_immuni_works_fourth">For technical reasons, <b>some Android smartphone models may stop Immuni from working if the app remains closed for a few days</b>. When this happens, random codes are still exchanged with other devices, but Immuni is not able to verify if you have been exposed to potentially infectious users and warn you if you are at risk. To prevent this from happening, open the app once a day. Google is working with the manufacturers of these models to solve the problem.</string>
    <string name="localisation_explanation_title">Why location services must be turned on</string>
    <string name="localisation_explanation_message_first">Immuni uses the exposure notification system developed by Apple, Google and Huawei. Due to an operating system limitation, location services must be turned on to allow background scanning of Bluetooth signals (necessary to exchange random codes and consequently log any contact that occurs).</string>
    <string name="localisation_explanation_message_second">However, the app does not have access to your location and therefore cannot track your movements. You can easily verify this by checking the list of permissions required by Immuni (available in your phone\'s Settings menu) and noting that authorisation to access your location is not required.</string>
