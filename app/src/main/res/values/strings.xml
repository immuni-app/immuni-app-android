    <string name="verify_immuni_works_fourth">Per motivi tecnici, <b>alcuni modelli di smartphone Android possono interrompere il funzionamento di Immuni se l’app rimane chiusa per qualche giorno</b>. Quando questo accade, lo scambio di codici casuali con altri dispositivi rimane attivo, ma Immuni non è in grado di verificare se sei stato esposto a utenti potenzialmente contagiosi, avvertendoti in caso di rischio. Per evitare che ciò accada, apri l’app una volta al giorno. Google sta collaborando con i produttori di questi modelli per risolvere il problema.</string>
