  <string name="permission_tutorial_why_province_region_title">A cosa serve inserire regione e provincia di domicilio</string>
  <string name="permission_tutorial_why_province_region_first">Regione e provincia di domicilio sono utili al Servizio Sanitario Nazionale per poter prevenire l’insorgenza di nuovi focolai, oltre che per poter stimare la diffusione dell’app sul territorio nazionale. La provincia di domicilio viene inviata al server del Ministero della Salute contestualmente alle informazioni sul corretto funzionamento dell’app e sul fatto che tu sia stato o meno avvertito di un contatto a rischio. Immuni raccoglie queste informazioni nella piena tutela della tua privacy.</string>
  <string name="permission_tutorial_why_province_region_second">È possibile modificare regione e provincia di domicilio in un qualsiasi momento dalle impostazioni dell’app. Ti consigliamo di modificarle solamente in caso tu decida di cambiare domicilio. In tutti gli altri casi, inclusi viaggi occasionali, non è invece necessario farlo.</string>
  <string name="permission_tutorial_why_province_region_third"><b>Nel caso in cui tu viva all’estero ma abbia intenzione di recarti in Italia, ti suggeriamo di selezionare già la regione (e successivamente la provincia) in cui soggiornerai per più tempo.</b> Puoi usare Immuni anche se ti trovi all’estero. L’app registrerà regolarmente i tuoi contatti con altri utenti. Non potrai tuttavia caricare i tuoi codici casuali in caso di rilevata positività fintanto che non ti troverai in Italia.</string>

  <string name="verify_immuni_works_fourth">For technical reasons, <b>some Android smartphone models may stop Immuni from working if the app remains closed for a few days</b>. When this happens, random codes are still exchanged with other devices, but Immuni is not able to verify if you have been exposed to potentially infectious users and warn you if you are at risk. To prevent this from happening, open the app once a day. Google is working with the manufacturers of these models to solve the problem.</string>
  <string name="localisation_explanation_title">Why location services must be turned on</string>
  <string name="localisation_explanation_message_first">Immuni uses the exposure notification system developed by Apple and Google. Due to an operating system limitation, location services must be turned on to allow background scanning of Bluetooth signals (necessary to exchange random codes and consequently log any contact that occurs).</string>
  <string name="localisation_explanation_message_second">However, the app does not have access to your location and therefore cannot track your movements. You can easily verify this by checking the list of permissions required by Immuni (available in your phone\'s Settings menu) and noting that authorisation to access your location is not required.</string>
